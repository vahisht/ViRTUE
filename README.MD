# ViRTUE
**Vi**rtual **R**eality **T**esting and **U**sability **E**xtension

This extension takes care of all the overhead when creating an OpenGL project for VR, making it quick and easy to develop and prototype projects for any VR HW supported by Steam VR runtime.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The extension currently requires following libraries

* **OpenVR**
* **Assimp**
* **OpenCV**
* **glm**
* **SDL2**
* **GLEW**

You can either install all libraries on your PC (manually or via [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)) or download them into the **Include** folder
